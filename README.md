# Home Assistant 'STEROIDS' Configuration

Here's my [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) configuration. I have installed HA on a [Raspberry Pi 3B+](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BDR5PDW) with a [Transcend High Endurance 32GB MicroSD Card](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDKTQY6) using the [HassIO option](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/) as I figured that for my current needs, I honestly dont need to invest too much in hardware. Once my CPU spikes and Load starts increasing, I'll probably upgrade to an Intel NUC or similar.

I maintain my configuration files almost every other week to keep up with the latest from HA. 
- Current HA version [here](.HA_VERSION).
